Got it 👍 — let’s organize the **graph algorithms in interview order** with **key notes** so you have a clear roadmap. This is essentially the “cheat sheet” of graph problems and their variations.

# 📚 Order of Graph Algorithms (Interview Roadmap)

## 1️⃣ Traversals (Foundation)
- **Algorithms:** BFS, DFS
- **Key Notes:**
    - BFS → Queue, level-order, shortest path in unweighted graphs.
    - DFS → Recursion/stack, used for connectivity, cycle detection, topological sort.
    - Complexity: \(O(V+E)\).
    - **Variations:** Connected components, path existence, tree traversals.

---

## 2️⃣ Cycle Detection
- **Algorithms:** DFS (undirected & directed), BFS with parent tracking, Kahn’s algorithm (directed), Union-Find (undirected).
- **Key Notes:**
    - Undirected: DFS/BFS with parent check.
    - Directed: DFS with recursion stack OR Kahn’s (topological sort).
    - Union-Find: Efficient for edge-list input.
    - Complexity: \(O(V+E)\).
    - **Variations:** Linked list cycle detection (Floyd’s fast/slow pointers).

---

## 3️⃣ Bipartite Graph Check
- **Algorithms:** BFS/DFS coloring.
- **Key Notes:**
    - Assign colors (0/1) to nodes; neighbors must have opposite colors.
    - Works for connected and disconnected graphs (loop through all nodes).
    - Complexity: \(O(V+E)\).
    - **Variations:** Matching problems, scheduling, 2-color problems.

---

## 4️⃣ Shortest Path Algorithms
- **Algorithms:**
    - BFS → Unweighted shortest path.
    - Dijkstra → Weighted graph (non-negative).
    - Bellman-Ford → Handles negative weights, detects negative cycles.
    - Floyd-Warshall → All-pairs shortest path.
- **Key Notes:**
    - BFS: \(O(V+E)\).
    - Dijkstra: \(O((V+E)\log V)\) with heap.
    - Bellman-Ford: \(O(V \cdot E)\).
    - Floyd-Warshall: \(O(V^3)\).
    - **Variations:** Path reconstruction, shortest path between two nodes, detecting cycles.

---

## 5️⃣ Minimum Spanning Tree (MST)
- **Algorithms:** Kruskal’s (Union-Find), Prim’s (Priority Queue).
- **Key Notes:**
    - Kruskal → Sort edges, pick cheapest without cycle. Best for sparse graphs.
    - Prim → Grow MST from a node, pick cheapest edge. Best for dense graphs.
    - Complexity:
        - Kruskal: \(O(E \log E)\).
        - Prim: \(O(E \log V)\).
    - **Variations:** Connected vs. disconnected graphs (forest MST).
    - **Applications:** Road networks, cable connections, clustering.

|-------|------------------|-----------------------------------|-----------|
| 1     | Traversals       | BFS, DFS                          | Foundation, connectivity, shortest path (unweighted) |
| 2     | Cycle Detection  | DFS, BFS, Kahn’s, Union-Find      | Directed vs. undirected, detect cycles |
| 3     | Bipartite Check  | BFS/DFS coloring                  | 2-coloring, disconnected graphs |
| 4     | Shortest Path    | BFS, Dijkstra, Bellman-Ford, Floyd-Warshall | Weighted/unweighted, negative cycles |
| 5     | MST              | Kruskal, Prim                     | Minimum cost spanning tree, forest MST |

## 🚀 Key Takeaways
- **Start with Traversals** → BFS/DFS are the backbone.
- **Cycle Detection & Bipartite** → Classic applications of traversal + coloring.
- **Shortest Path** → Builds on BFS/DFS, introduces weights.
- **MST** → Optimization problems, real-world scenarios (roads, cables).
- **Complexity awareness** is critical — interviewers often ask why you chose BFS vs. Dijkstra, or Kruskal vs. Prim.

🔑 Quick Takeaways
- Shortest Path Algorithms:
- Dijkstra → Fast, but only for non-negative weights.
- Bellman–Ford → Slower, but works with negative weights and detects negative cycles.
- Floyd–Warshall → Computes shortest paths between all pairs of nodes, useful for dense graphs.
- Minimum Spanning Tree Algorithms:
- Kruskal → Works edge-first, great when edges are fewer and sorting is efficient.
- Prim → Works vertex-first, efficient with adjacency structures and priority queues.


----------
👉 If you’re preparing for interviews, a good way to remember is:
- Dijkstra = GPS navigation (fast routes, no negative roads).
- Bellman–Ford = More versatile, can handle “penalties” (negative weights).
- Floyd–Warshall = All-pairs, like computing a full distance matrix.
- Kruskal & Prim = Building cheapest network connections (like laying cables or roads).
- kruskal -> uses union of disjoint sets , prim ->
